This is a frontend solution/simulation where we assume that
 - All the info and data of the products are received from a server
 - The data is manipulated after that
 - The HTML is build using this data
 - The page is rendered dynamically. From the backend, or using components with JS


Answers to possible questions, clarifications, etc:
Classes could be used to define and manipulate objects and their data as that would make things easier

The items/products could be set as radio buttons (we should make sure that it will always work on that way)

All the images should have the same size to avoid weird/unexpected behaviors
Also, they could be lazy loaded while being hidden before the user interacts

jQuery is being used for DOM manipulation
As jQuery is used, the attributes "data-..." in the HTML are used just for a clearer syntax
